	Swalwell, 38, announced his candidacy for President of the United States in April. With a rallying cry of “Go big, be bold, do good,” Swalwell is putting his experience and energy to work for America. He was first in his family to go to college and served as a prosecutor and city councilman before winning his House seat in 2012. His campaign priorities include ending gun violence; providing healthcare for all and finding cures for our deadliest diseases; reducing student loan debt; and combating climate chaos. He’s fighting to bring the promise of America – that hard work must lead to a better life for you and your family – to all Americans.</p>
